/**
 * <p>
 * <code>Transaction</code> is any interesting unit of work that takes time to complete and may fail.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Basically, all data access across the boundary needs to be logged as a <code>Transaction</code> since it may fail and
 * time consuming. For example, URL request, disk IO, JDBC query, search query, HTTP request, 3rd party API call etc.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Sometime if A needs call B which is owned by another team, although A and B are deployed together without any
 * physical boundary. To make the ownership clear, there could be some <code>Transaction</code> logged when A calls B.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Most of <code>Transaction</code> should be logged in the infrastructure level or framework level, which is
 * transparent to the application.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * All CAT message will be constructed as a message tree and send to back-end for further analysis, and for monitoring.
 * Only <code>Transaction</code> can be a tree node, all other message will be the tree leaf.ã€€The transaction without
 * other messages nested is an atomic transaction.
 * </p>
